DSA Learning Journey in Java 

Welcome to our Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! 
This is a collaborative project between two friends on a mission to crack campus placements by mastering DSA concepts using Java. 
Our goal is to be well-prepared for coding interviews, competitive programming contests, and land our dream jobs!

üìö About This Repository
This repository is designed to help us:
- Master Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hashing, etc.)
- Implement and optimize **Algorithms** (Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, etc.)
- Solve problems from **coding platforms** like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, and more
- Sharpen our problem-solving skills for **campus placements** and coding interviews
- Stay consistent and collaborate on solving complex problems, as we both aim to improve our coding skills

üöÄ Our Approach
We are following a structured approach to crack campus placements:
1. Weekly Topic Focus: Every week, we choose specific DSA topics to work on, such as Arrays, Trees, Dynamic Programming, etc.
2. LeetCode & HackerRank Practice: Solving problems from these platforms to get used to the kind of questions asked in interviews.
3. Mock Interviews & Peer Review: We regularly conduct mock interviews and review each other's code for optimal solutions.
4. Problem-Solving Practice: We aim to solve at least 5-10 problems per week to improve our coding speed and accuracy.
5. Learning & Sharing: We document our learning, share explanations, and add helpful resources in this repository.

‚úçÔ∏è How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch for each topic or coding problem you're working on.
3. Write clean, efficient code with clear explanations.
4. Test your code thoroughly and ensure it passes all test cases.
5. Push your changes and create a pull request with a brief description of what you've done.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
- Java for implementing data structures and algorithms.
- Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration.
- LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces for coding challenges and interview practice.
- JUnit for writing and running unit tests (when applicable).
- VS Code/IntelliJ IDEA for coding and debugging.
